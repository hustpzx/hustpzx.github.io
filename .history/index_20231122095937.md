<br>
Here is **Zhouxuan Peng**.


I am a Ph.D student majoring in Computer System and Architecture at *Huazhong University of Science and Technology* ([**HUST**](https://www.hust.edu.cn/)). Currently, I'm a member of *Data Storage and Application Laboratory* ([DSAL](http://stlab.wnlo.hust.edu.cn/index.jsp)) (supervised by: [**Dan Feng**](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/dfeng/zh_CN/index.htm)). The main research interests include Non-Volatile Memories (NVM), Heterogeneous Memory Systems, Disaggregated Memory Architecture, and Processing in Memory Architecture. <br><br>
